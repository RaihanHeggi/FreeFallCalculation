# FreeFallCalculation
Simply Application to Calculate FreeFall with Numerical Methods soon this Application can use to Simulate Freefall

This Program made from Euler Numerical Methods. 

Run this program with python
and you need to install NumPy, and MATLIBPLOT.PYPLOT to run this program 

yeah, this program needs more update on making graph and menu, and still need better calculation methods.
